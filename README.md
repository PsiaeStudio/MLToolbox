## Supported Mod Loaders
  1. [Unreal Engine Pak Patcher](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/patching-content-delivery-and-dlc-in-unreal-engine)
  2. [RE-UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS)

## FAQ

### Why make this ?
I wanted a mod manager, named toolbox because it will be more than just a mod manager, it's not strictly just for Manor Lords, there will be implementation for it to work with other games built with Unreal Engine.

### Why primarily Kotlin not C# or C++ or JS ?
Ergonomics, for me it's the most comfortable to work with at night.

### Will this app stay relevant after mod support is out ?
Yes, even more.

### Does this project accept source code contribution ?
Yes, but only for open issues, you will be properly credited.
